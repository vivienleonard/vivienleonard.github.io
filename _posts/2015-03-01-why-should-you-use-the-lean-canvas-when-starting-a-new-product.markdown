Lean is about continuously improving your processes. How? **Avoiding wastes** in anything you do, and being **centered on your clients needs**. As there is a tendency in any company to waste time in plenty of useless tasks, lean management can help to solve this issue by creating more value for the clients using less resources. You can adopt this attitude in the small steps of the daily life of a project:  
Do you really need to write a document that you will be the only one to read?  
Do you really need to make a meeting with 10 people just to discuss?

To put it more simply, think of it as the following equation:
> productivity = work + waste  

Eliminate the wastes as much as possible and you will increase your productivity, it is as simple as this.

The lean canvas is a lean rework of the business model canvas, and was issued recently in 2009. His creator, Ash Maurya, explains why he has been creating it [here][1].
The purpose of these two canvas is to **validate or document a business model**.

Three years ago, the offices of the company I was working for were surrounded by startups. This dynamic and creative environment had been contaminating me, and I thought, let's try it. I had identified some problems in the retail area for which I thought I had good solutions, and I began to work on a prototype. Even if this was more a hobby project rather than a serious attempt to create a company, I had invested a crazy amount of time into it. I've stopped the project after a bit more than one year, and one the many reasons was that I was lacking a frame helping me to not go in directions not helping my potential clients.

One of the believes I had at this moment of time, was that you could make a good technical product, and try to push this product on the market by traction, without any business plan. I did not want to invest energy into writing one as this was a side project, seeing it as a loss of time. This was a huge mistake, because it definitely helps to setup a frame around your project. A business plan is not just for investors, but also to help you to advance in a structured way, avoiding wastes. I wrote one, but too late, when no more energy to involve in this project was left.

The lean canvas would have save me a lot of time because I see it as a simplified and concise one view page of the business plan. It is easy to understand, easy to communicate with your colleagues, easy to update. And you can have it done within some hours. If you try to launch a product as a side project, this is a great asset.
And what I like the most is that it reminds you immediately something we forget to often when starting a new project: **What is the problem I am trying to solve**, and what is the solution I have for it?

I would have like to know about it 3 years ago, and I would have eventually:
* Kept focus on a solution for the market I was targeting instead of adding plenty of features to try to cover the highest possible range of potential clients.
* Better estimate the impact of a long acquisition client cycle (over one year) which was an issue without investors involved in the project.
* Kept the small team I had form motivated by having clear and simple goals, instead of going in different directions trying to please everyone, which was resulting in pleasing no one.

I have the impression that the lean canvas is pretty popular in the startup world, but somehow, I would like to see it being used internally in big companies. It would probably raise the quality of internal processes, documents and deliverables being produced. It is damn simple, and complex behavior emerges from simple rules. Big companies have complex processes, and you sometimes get low quality outputs.
