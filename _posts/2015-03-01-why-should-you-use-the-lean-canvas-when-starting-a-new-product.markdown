Lean is about continuously improving your processes, **avoiding wastes** in anything you do, and being **centered on your clients needs**. As there is a tendency in any company to waste time in plenty of useless tasks, having this attitude can help.

Simply stated:
> productivity = work + waste  

Eliminate the wastes as much as possible and you will increase your productivity.

The lean canvas is a lean rework of the business model canvas, and was issued [recently][1] in 2009. The purpose of these two canvas is to **validate or document a business model**.

Three years ago, the offices of the company I was working for were surrounded by startups. This dynamic and creative environment had been contaminating me, and I thought, let's try it. I had identified some problems in the retail area for which I was sure to have good solutions, and I began to work on a prototype. Even if this was more a hobby project rather than a serious attempt to create a company, I had invested a crazy amount of time into it. To validate the need I had identified, I entered around 50 retails shops of the town I was leaving in, and spoke with the managers. They had even more problems than the ones I had identified, which I saw as a good sign. But after a bit more than one year, I've stopped the whole project, and one the many reasons is that I was lacking a frame helping me to focus on a solution for the market I was targeting.

One of the believes I had at this moment of time, was that you could make a good technical product, and try to push this product on the market by traction, without any business plan. Make a prototype, show the prototype, iterate, that did not work. And why? Because I did not want to invest energy into writing a business plan as this was a side project. I had few time available and tought that writing one would be a complete loss of time. This was a huge mistake, because it definitely helps to setup a frame around your project. A business plan is not just for investors, but also to help you to advance in a structured way, avoiding wastes. I wrote one, but too late, when no more energy to involve in this project was left.

As I was lacking a structure, here are some of the mistakes I did:

- Meeting the retail shop owners was a nice experience, but they had so many problems with the existing solutions that I ended up designing a monster prototype containing too much features to implement. I had managed to form a team of 4 working on the prototype, but for the size of the team we were, that was too much and I was the one which was responsible to say "stop, let's focus". But I was throwing any decent idea that was coming into the prototype thinking that it would be easier to gain clients, and the prototype was a half-assed product in the end.
- In this area, the acquisition client cycle is quite long (at least one year) which was an issue without investors involved in the project.
- Going in different directions trying to please everyone in the team had been impacting the motivation of the team. You try to please everyone, and you end up pleasing no one.

Where the lean canvas can help? Because it is like a simplified and concise one view page of the business plan. You can have a first version done in 30 minutes, and have a frame to begin to move on.  

- it is easy to write
- it is easy to understand
- it is easy to communicate with your team if you have one
- it is easy to update

If you try to launch a product as a side project, this is a great asset.

And everytime you look at it, it reminds you immediately something easy to forget in the life of a project: **What are the problems I am trying to solve?**.
Here you are limited to 3 and this good. I wanted to solve 3 problems at the beginning, and 50 in the end.

I have the impression that the lean canvas is pretty popular in the startup world, but somehow, I would like to see it being used in established companies. It would probably raise the quality of internal processes, documents and deliverables being produced. **It is damn simple, and complex behavior emerges from simple rules.**
