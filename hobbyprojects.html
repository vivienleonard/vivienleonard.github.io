            <p><a href="http://tracemoi.herokuapp.com/">trace moi</a> is a website I did so that restaurants can present suppliers they work with. Restaurants that actually do not just use industrial preparations represent actually only around 10% of the total amount of restaurants in France.</p>
            <p>I've stopped it after 6 months because of the lack of visits, and as a consequence, there is only 1 example restaurant on it currently. </p>
            <p>The website is implemented with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails.</a></p>

        <div class="post">
        <p>The problematic I wanted to solve for retail groups was to offer a full software solution to replace what they have today: multiple software providers with loss of data in between. By having a unique software provider, it would be possible to ease the visibility of data, and enhance innovation, with the benefit of doing it a lower cost.</p>
        <p>With a small team, we've tried an <a href="http://www.orange.fr/" target="_blank">Orange</a> contest in december 2012 with title Fiber & 4G for startups and the following brochure: <a href="images/hobbies/4shops.pdf" target="_blank">download</a>.<p/>
        <p>We had a prototype of back-end being a web application, and a point of sale on an iPad.</p>
        <p>The project was stopped being to big to achieve with the size of the team we had, and because of the long cycle of client acquisition in this domain, which was an issue without investors in the loop.</a>
